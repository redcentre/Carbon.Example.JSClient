# Overview

This repository contains an example HTML5 client application that calls the Carbon web service to open jobs and generate cross-tabulation reports. The app consists of a single html page, a css style sheet and a JavaScript file, so it is a good example of a simple application that can be created with web browser native tooling. Developers can use the sample markup and JavaScript as the basis for a more sophisticated applicatio, perhaps using one of the popular contemporary JS frameworks.

The example page can be previewed at this address:

:memo: *Note that the application only consists of 3 core files (html, css and js). The other files in the repository only exist so that the folder can be opened in Visual Studio 2022 and provide colourisation and intellisense when editing the core files.*
