# Overview

This repository contains an example HTML5 client application that calls the Carbon web service to open jobs and generate cross-tabulation reports. The app consists of a single html page, a css style sheet and a JavaScript file, so it is a good example of a simple application that can be created with web browser native tooling. Developers can use the sample markup and JavaScript as the basis for a more sophisticated application, perhaps using one of the popular contemporary JS frameworks.

The example page can be previewed at this address:
